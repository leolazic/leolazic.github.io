				<h>Regarding the Euphoria, Duration and Questionableness of				
				Discoveries in Art </h>
				</p>
				<p>
					The quote below is from "The Power of the Center : A Study of
					Composition in the Visual Arts" by Rudolf Arnheim
				</p>
				<p>
					"This book has been entirely rewritten. There are paragraphs here
					and there and even an occasional page that have remained untouched,
					but more likely than not they will now be found in different
					places. A few illustrations have been added, others have been
					dropped, and a comparison between the table of contents of the
					earlier edition and that of the present one will show substantial
					rearrangements.
				</p>
				<p>
					How can such thorough revamping be justified? How is it even
					possible? I shall try to explain. The first writing of the book was
					influenced by the happy realization that I had made a discovery.
					Composition, a prime requirement of any organized visual statement,
					has been discussed for centuries by artists, art theorists, and
					critics. Practical rules for proportion and spatial arrangement
					have been proposed; intuitive judgments of good and faulty balance
					have been presented: triangles and circles and all sorts of arrows
					have been drawn on reproductions of works of art. Some of these
					devices looked more convincing than others, but most of them
					applied to particular works of art or to particular styles.
					Principles of composition that might apply universally to
					buildings, sculpture, and painting, to the applied arts as well as
					the fine ones, regardless of their place and time of origin, were
					not sought out. They were considered unattainable and perhaps
					undesirable.
				</p>
				<p>
					My own training and inclination have always led me to what things
					have in common rather than what distinguishes them. Looking at the
					offering of the arts of the ages as the collective attempt of
					mankind to explore the endlessly variable ways of giving shape to
					one thing, art, I became increasingly convinced that composition,
					in whatever style or medium, derived from the interaction of two
					visual principles, which I now call the centric and the eccentric
					systems. I began to see reasons for the necessary universality of
					these principles, and as the search for them opened my eyes to the
					organization and meaning of more and more works in the various
					forms of art, I felt ready to give an account of what I had found.
					The mounting evidence telling me that what I was seeing could be
					seen everywhere and the euphoria accompanying this discovery and
					confirmation led me to write the first version of the book in the
					order dictated by inspiration..."
