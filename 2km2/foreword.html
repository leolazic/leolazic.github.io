				This work is about an encounter between a man and desert. In this
				case, a man with a camera and with artistic inclinations. An intense
				encounter that spans over three years, from the first sight to the
				taking of the last image.
				<br />
				The outcome could be seen to represent three stages of development
				in a photographer's sensibility. Stages that are somewhat
				reminiscent, if not a retracing, of the way (landscape) photography
				has been used since its inception.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first stage, in colour (chapter 1), brings travel photography to
				mind. The wish to share with others the spectacular beauty of
				nature. In time, and with a number of such images, the mind is less
				and less impressed. The photographer also realizes that others could
				take similar pictures, and he wants to push the limits. He wants to
				leave his imprint on the images he makes, to sign them visually.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second stage (chapter 2), he finds his style and establishes
				his vision. Working now in black & white adds dramatic and other
				overtones to his images. Eventually, however, he realizes that
				although there may be more sense of art in these images than in the
				colour ones from chapter 1, it is a sort of art that begins to feel
				artificial. Working in black & white, while at first beneficial,
				turns after a while from support to obstacle. The visual reduction
				taking place in monochrome photography turns quickly and easily from
				aestheticizing to mannerism.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, in the third stage (chapter 3), the photographer reverts to
				colour. But no longer in search of spectacular beauty of the grand
				landscape. Instead, he starts noticing the seemingly banal in
				nature. The non-obvious. The barely discernible. At the same time,
				unwittingly, his composition shifts from being based on the golden
				mean, as it does in the first two stages, to being more concerned
				with the centre.
